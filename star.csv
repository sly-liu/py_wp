Evangeline Lilly,Actress,"Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada","August 3,      1979","Evangeline Lilly, born in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, in 1979, was discovered on the streets of Kelowna, British Columbia, by the famous Ford modeling agency. Although she initially decided to pass on a modeling career, she went ahead and signed with Ford anyway, to help pay for her University of British Columbia tuition and expenses.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       RaDragon","I\'m very picky when it comes to men. I come across a man who I\'m really attracted to about once every five years.|I love being outside - that\'s where I\'m the happiest.|I feel like I\'m in boot camp. On Lost (2004) - my first year was baptism by fire. I just was thrown in. And I had no idea what I was doing, not just on set, and not just as an actor, but as a public figure. I had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea how to cope with it, and what the best ways were to manage it. I\'m constantly learning that and therefore, in learning it, I knew I didn\'t want to - one of the first things I knew was, I don\'t want to have this beast become so big and uncontrollable that I am swallowed up by it.|To put it simply - you know, a lot of people believe that the benefit of this job is fame and fortune. I believe that you pay for the fortune through the fame. I don\'t buy into the notion that being famous is somehow a good thing, or an exciting thing, or a wonderful thing. I think it\'s more cumbersome and more of a hindrance to your life than it is the other. But the fortune is fantastic. I\'ll take it, and I have no complaints. But it\'s not - you know, I didn\'t become an actress because I wanted to be famous. I didn\'t become an actress because this is the ultimate career goal of my life. I became an actress by accident. I was doing a psychological exercise with myself, challenging myself, by going to auditions. I had no idea that it would connect to a job. I had no intention for it to connect to a job. I was doing it as an exercise. So when I got a job, I, in that moment, had to sit down and go, ""Do I want to be an actor?""|Even if you\'re unhappy, just pretend that you\'re happy. Eventually, your smile will be contagious to yourself. I had to learn that, I used to think, \'I\'m being fake,\' but you know what? Better to be fake and happy than real and miserable. [on her mindset]|[on adding feminine energy to characters in \'The Hobbit\' film series] To his defence, Tolkien was writing in 1937. The world is a different place today. I kept repeatedly telling people that in this day and age, to put nine hours of cinema entertainment in theatres for young girls to go and watch, and not have one female character - it\'s subliminally telling them that \'You don\'t matter, you\'re not important and you\'re not pivotal to the story\'. I think that they were very brave and very right in saying \'We won\'t do that to the young female audience that will come and watch our films\'. And even for women my own age, I think it\'s time that we stop making stories that are only about men. I love that they make Tauriel a hero.|[when approached by a woman from Ford Modeling Agency, who encouraged Lilly to contact the company] No thanks, you\'re wasting your time.|I think there\'s a part of everyone that\'s intrigued by the thought of being recognised.|One time there was this guy who was really awful to me [when I was a flight attendant], and I was really struggling that day, because I had really bad gas. And as a flight attendant, you don\'t let that go when you\'re on a plane. So this guy got under my skin to the point that finally I decided to save it all up, and when I was walking past him and when I got to row 48... I let it rip, right in his face.|If I didn\'t try to help others, I\'d be no better than the Paris Hiltons of the world, waltzing around with their Louis Vuitton bags and their little dogs. Those people couldn\'t give a rat\'s ass if somebody was starving on the street next to them.|I actually feel like I\'m more capable now of doing humanitarian work because I\'m financially able to make a difference. You have to sacrifice something to get something. For me, fame is that sacrifice, because I never wanted it, and I still don\'t. It\'s something I have to live with.|I spent many nights crying myself to sleep wishing I was ugly because of the way men leered and disrespected me, because they assumed things about my mental capacity or my physical willingness based on the way I look.|Hollywood is the Sodom and Gomorrah of today. It\'s a world I avoid because it\'s destroying our culture. And yet, I\'ve recently seen a turnaround. People like George Clooney and Michael Moore are using Hollywood as a platform to send out positive messages.|[Working as a flight attendant for Royal Airlines was] the worst job [I ever had]. That job has no redeeming qualities. I didn\'t like the people. I didn\'t like the destinations. I didn\'t like the recycled air, the crappy food.|[on reading a biography of Audrey Hepburn] Wow, that is the life I would kill to emulate.|When I was a kid, the Fort was tiny. I could ride my bike at five years old from one end of town to the other... To me Fort Saskatchewan holds a lot of really great memories.

Taylor Lautner,Actor,"Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","February 11,      1992","Taylor Daniel Lautner was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Deborah, a software company worker, and Daniel Lautner, a pilot for Midwest Airlines. He, and younger sister Makena, were raised in a well-mannered, Roman Catholic household in Hudsonville, Michigan. He is of English, German, Dutch, and Scottish descent. At the age of six, Taylor began studying martial arts at Fabiano\'s Karate School and he, along with his family, quickly noticed his unique and natural talent for the sport. He was soon invited to train with seven-time world karate champion Michael Chaturantabut (aka Mike Chat) and, at the age of eight, he was asked to represent his country in the twelve years and under division in the World Karate Association where he became the Junior World Forms and Weapons champion, winning three gold medals. In 2003, Taylor continued to flourish in the martial arts circuit where he ranked number one in the world for NASKA\'s Black Belt Open Forms, Musical Weapons, Traditional Weapons and Traditional Forms and, at the age of twelve, he became the three time Junior World Champion.However, in addition to his love for martial arts, Taylor quickly developed a love for acting at the age of seven years old when his martial arts instructor, who was involved in show business, encouraged him to audition for a small appearance in a Burger King commercial. Although he was unsuccessful, he enjoyed the experience so much that he told his parents that he wanted to pursue a career in acting. Soon, he and his family were traveling back-and-forth from their home in Michigan to California so Taylor could audition for acting roles on a regular basis. When Taylor was ten, with the frequent traveling and air fares starting to become overwhelming, his family made the crucial decision to relocate to Los Angeles where Taylor would have the advantage of being able to audition for films, television, and commercials full-time.Once Taylor moved with his family to Los Angeles, he found himself landing more and more small acting roles. He booked many occurring roles on various television shows such as My Wife and Kids (2001), Summerland (2004), and The Bernie Mac Show (2001). Taylor also found himself becoming successful in films as well. In 2005, he landed the role of Sharkboy in the family blockbuster flick, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005), and the role of Eliot Murtaugh in Cheaper by the Dozen 2 (2005). However, it would be one single role that would ultimately change Taylor\'s life forever. In 2008, Taylor auditioned for the iconic role of werewolf hunk Jacob Black in the record smashing, blockbuster hit Twilight (2008). With the sudden and unexpected success of the film, Taylor, along with fellow cast members Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, found himself being propelled into a world that would forever change his life and his career.Taylor has continued to portray Jacob Black in the following film adaptations of the The Twilight Saga as well as branch out into other roles and films such as the star studded romantic comedy, Valentine\'s Day (2010), and the action-packed thriller, Abduction (2011). Taylor Lautner has quickly become one of the most famous, talented, and successful young Hollywood actors thanks to the blockbuster success of the Twilight (2008) films. It has quickly been established by this young man\'s diverse and gifted talent that we will continue to be his audience for many years to come.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Anonymous","[About the \'Twilight\' phenomenon] It\'s really unlike anything else. I know that over the past couple of years, I\'ve had the time of my life and I\'m very thankful, but it is different. It\'s almost like you live two different worlds and you completely vanish and then you go back to your regular life.|I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don\'t know...one of my favorite movies is The Notebook (2004) so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It\'s about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.|[About presenting at the Oscars for the first time] I was freaking! It\'s probably the most nervous I\'ve ever been. Just standing up on that stage and looking down at the people that you\'ve watched your entire life. It was crazy...I wouldn\'t let myself lock eyes with any one person because I would have just stopped talking. If I would have locked eyes with Leo (Leonardo DiCaprio) or George Clooney or someone I would not have been able to speak so I was trying to avoid that.|[About his new found fame and avoiding the paparazzi] Yeah, you definitely use a lot of back-entrances and exits, but I think for the most part, we (meaning his fellow Twilight (2008) cast members, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart) just go along for the ride. We\'re the same people that we were before and we have people behind us that kind of help us think ahead and we\'re just thankful to have that help. When we walk through hotels, we always walk through the kitchen or through the garbage room or the laundry room. It\'s that not glamorous, trust me.|[About hosting Saturday Night Live (1975) for the first time] They tell you beforehand that ""the cast is great, you\'re not going to be nervous, your just going to have fun"" and I was like ""yeah, okay"" and don\'t get me wrong I had a lot of fun, but I was nervous. When I got the offer for it, I was like ""Listen guys it\'s such an honor, but I don\'t sing, I don\'t dance, and I don\'t do accents and that\'s pretty much what SNL is"" so I was really nervous, but it was a lot of fun.|A dream acting role would be Matt Damon in the Bourne series. I would love to do something like that!|[About his favorite quote from \'Twilight\'] It\'s not in the first book, but the quote I love the most is Jacob\'s quote, ""Does my being half-naked bother you?"" That quote just cracks me up. Because he\'s always half-naked throughout the series, it\'s just a good way to rock the fact that he\'s always shirtless.|[About his experience with the \'Twilight\' fans in Brazil] When we (meaning himself and Kristen Stewart) traveled to Brazil to promote The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009), we were told ahead of time that our Brazilian fans may possibly be a little more enthusiastic then the fans we were used to. We weren\'t too worried. But one day when we were doing interviews in our hotel room, our security guard rushes into the room and tells us to remain calm, but 2,000 girls just stormed the hotel lobby and were on their way up to our room. That was the only time I ever felt in danger with the fans!|[on his taste in music] One second I\'ll be listening to country, and then the next I\'ll be listening to rock and then R&B. It\'s ridiculous. I\'m all over the place with my music.|[on his initial reaction to the book release of \'Breaking Dawn\'] It caught me by surprise when I read the book. I think I originally heard what happened through somebody who had already read it, and I didn\'t believe them. I thought they were joking and then when I read the book, I was like, ""You\'ve got to be kidding me"".|[The qualities he looks for most in a woman] Obviously loyalty and honesty, but mostly someone who can let loose, be themselves and not put on a show.|[How it felt on the last day of filming The The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 (2012)] Well we\'ve literally been filming these movies for the past three to four years, so it was very strange to know that I\'m not going back to play Jacob Black anymore. And yes, we were all pretty upset, but I think, to my surprise, the one who was the most emotional was Kristen (Kristen Stewart). But I predicted from the beginning that we would all be upset and on the last day, it did get emotional.|[on filming Abduction (2011)] When I saw the script, it had probably five or six shirtless scenes, and it got cut down to one short one. It had to make sense for the character. We found the one moment when it would work and that was it.|[on attention from fans] I\'ve had a few girls that have tattooed my signature on their arm. I mean that blows my mind! Something new happens every day and it continues to blow my mind.",w,p,pt,s,st,12,evangeline lilly GIF|evangeline lilly superhero GIF|marvel superhero GIF|evangeline lilly girl GIF|evangeline lilly blake GIF|evangeline lilly GIF|lee pace thorin GIF|the hobbit GIF|evangeline lilly film GIF|evangeline lilly e evie GIF| |season 1 beach GIF|evangeline lilly e evie GIF|ian somerhalder GIF|game of thrones hobbit GIF|,2019-04-17 15:55:02

She then appeared opposite George Clooney in Intolerable Cruelty (2003), Ocean\'s Twelve (2004) and reprised her starring role in the sequel The Legend of Zorro (2005).In November 2000, she married actor Michael Douglas.

It wasn\'t until I started being myself, the way I like to turn out to meet people, that I started to get any work.|I like women who look like women. I hated grunge. No one\'s more feminist than me, but you don\'t have to look as if you don\'t give a - you know. You can be smart, bright and attractive aesthetically to others - and to yourself.|In Wales it\'s brilliant. I go to the pub and see everybody who I went to school with. And everybody goes ""So what you doing now?"". And I go, ""Oh, I\'m doing a film with Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins."" And they go, ""Ooh, good."" And that\'s it.|After Scottish actor Sean Connery presented her with the Oscar: A Scotsman giving a Welsh girl an Oscar - oh my God!|After The Mask of Zorro (1998), people spoke Spanish to me for ages. I\'m Welsh but that movie instantly gave me a new ethnicity.|For marriage to be a success, every woman and every man should have her and his own bathroom. The end.|[on her duel/strip scene from The Mask of Zorro (1998)]: I kept thinking ""Thank God, I have long hair in this movie."".|[on The Mask of Zorro (1998)] This film holds a lot of meaning to me, both professionally and personally. I actually met my husband when I was promoting the film in Deauville, France, and it was such an amazing time for me, being completely unknown, really, in America or in Mexico, where I shot the first one. It\'s a very important film for me and it\'s very close to my heart.|I wish I was born in that era: by dancing with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, going to work at the studio dressed in beautiful pants, head scarves and sunglasses.|[on landing the role of Velma Kelly in Chicago (2002)] Did I want this role? That\'s like saying did I want to wake up in the morning wanting to breathe!|I do think I\'m lucky I met Michael. Not just Michael Douglas the actor and producer with two Oscars on the shelf, but Michael Douglas, the love of my life. I really do think it was meant to happen.|I like to feel sexy. I know my husband thinks I\'m sexy. I think he is too. But I don\'t go out half-naked with \'sex\' written across my back.|[on what makes a man irresistable] Humor and that wonderful word called \'charisma\'. You cannot translate it. I can\'t nail it on the head, other than to just say that I\'m completely over the top about my husband.|Yes, I was in love with my husband at first sight and still am. We have the most solid relationship.|[on the Internet and its fascination with celebrities and pornography] I don\'t go into the triple-X sites. I\'m certainly not going to pay money to see myself naked, when I can just go into the bathroom and whip it off for free.|I\'m more insecure than I ever let anyone know, sometimes you protect yourself with this kind of armor that people see more than they see you.|I was a chorus girl. That\'s all I ever wanted - to be onstage. I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take me two tries, but I always got the job. I figured out what they wanted.|[on playing Desiree Armfeldt in ""A Little Night Music"" on Broadway in 2010]: There\'s no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings, but really that\'s what excited me. With most musicals you have to fill in the gaps, but here you have what\'s already a beautiful Chekhovian play, and the music is a bonus. The characterization is everything. It\'s not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging.|[on singing ""Send in the Clowns"" in ""A Little Night Music"" on Broadway in 2010]: As an actor what do you do? You try to make it your own. It was never supposed to be a big song. It\'s very intimate, about a woman being told that she\'s not going to be with the love of her life. How are you supposed to sing when you\'re that deflated?|[on playing Desiree Armfeldt in ""A Little Night Music"" on Broadway in 2010]: I\'d read the phone book with the people here, people of this caliber. I feel at this point in my life I\'m in my second chapter. You have to be quite frank with yourself. There\'s that wonderful curve, and then this is the way it is: the second act. It\'s great that now I can go back to my roots but in a completely different way.|[on being awarded the CBE in June 2010] As a British subject, I feel incredibly proud, at the same time it is overwhelming and humbling. And my mum and dad are delighted beyond belief.|I didn\'t even think about movies where I came from. I wanted to be on the stage. When I was 10, I did Annie in the West End. I did Bugsy Malone when I was 11 and 12. And then at 16, David Merrick saw me in 42nd Street. I took over the lead and he cast me. I was there for two and a half years. Right now, these young kids are going crazy. I never had that because I had a work ethic. I had to turn up and be there six nights a week.|[1996] I could never see myself living in Hollywood unless I really had to, it\'s not really my kind of place.|Being happy is the real key to beauty.
